      <h1>Global Explanation</h1>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <img src="demographics.png" alt="Model arc" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
      <p>The data comes from Aravind Eye Hospital, consisting of 3662 retina images taken using fundus photography 
with patients demographic information(age, gender), names are compeletly hidden for privacy. A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4.
We can see that female consists 80% and male 20%, suggesting our model could potentially perform better on female patients' scans. 
Age are from 20-80 distributed uniformly. And for the severity label, 0 is the most, then 2 consists large amount, and class 1,4,3 are fewer number.

      <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
      <img src="model_arc.png" alt="Model arc" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
      <p>We use in our product ResNet50, which is a deep convolutional neural network architecture consisting of 50 layers and is widely used in 
image recognition tasks. It is known for its high accuracy, robustness and efficiency, making it a popular choice for various computer 
vision applications. The model is designed to handle complex image data efficiently and accurately, with a total of 27,794,309 
parameters. This extensive number of parameters allows ResNet50 to learn detailed and intricate patterns in the data, 
leading to high performance across many challenging datasets.</p>

      <h2>Model Accuracy</h2>
      <img src="model_acc.png" alt="Model acc" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
      <p>Our model, based on the ResNet50 architecture, has demonstrated strong performance in detecting diabetic retinopathy
 from smartphone-captured eye images. Throughout its training phase, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.89, 
 indicating a high level of reliability in identifying patterns indicative of the condition. When evaluated on a separate 
 test dataset, the model maintained a robust accuracy of 0.84, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability in 
 real-world scenarios. This performance underscores the model's potential as a valuable tool in medical diagnostics, 
 particularly for accessible screening in diverse settings.</p>

      <h2>Model Confusion Matrix</h2>
      <img src="model_confusion.png" alt="Model confusion" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">
      <p>

The confusion matrix displayed showcases the performance of our diabetic retinopathy detection model across five categories, 
from '0-No DR' to '4-Proliferative DR.' The diagonal elements represent the proportions of true positive predictions for each class, 
indicating that the model is highly accurate in identifying '0-No DR' with 98% accuracy. It also performs well for '1-Mild' and 
'2-Moderate' cases with 72% and 88% predicted correctly respectively. However, there is room for improvement in '3-Severe' and '4-Proliferative 
DR' categories, with accuracies of 36% and 52%, respectively, suggesting a lower accuracy in these advanced stages. For '3-Severe' and '4-Proliferate DR the model 
tend to predict as '2-Moderate'y, underestimating the serverness, therefore it needs physician's attention in the '2-Moderate' prediction, 
because other classes may be wrongly predicted as '2-Moderate'.
