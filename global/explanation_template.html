      <h1>Global Explanation</h1>
      <h2>Overall System Functioning and Role of Automation</h2>
      <p>Our diabetic retinopathy detection app is engineered to leverage the capabilities of modern smartphones combined with a simple lens 
            attachment, enabling trained users such as nurses and volunteers to conduct preliminary screenings for this eye condition. 
            The core functionality of this system lies in its use of a sophisticated deep learning model, based on the ResNet50 architecture, 
            which analyzes images captured by the smartphone's camera. This automation plays a crucial role by providing a preliminary 
            assessment of the patientâ€™s risk for diabetic retinopathy, thus enabling early intervention. Automation significantly 
            enhances the app's ability to process and interpret complex visual data quickly and accurately, offering a crucial diagnostic 
            support tool in environments where traditional medical equipment is scarce and before it's too late! </p>
      <h2>Notice of System Use for Individual and Organization Responsible</h2>
      <p>Our diabetic retinopathy detection app is deployed with a clear notice to all stakeholders, including Data Scientists, IT professionals and 
            software developers, ethics boards and regulatory authorities... This is crucial for maintaining trust and facilitating effective collaboration among stakeholders, such as:<br>
            Data Scientist who develop models and ensures data integrity and model fairness. <br>
            Healthcare IT teams who integrate the app within existing health systems.<br>
            and Software Engineers who deploy models and build systems. <br>
            Ethics boards who carefully check our app to make sure it's fair and transparent. <br>
            Regulatory authorities make sure that our app meets all the legal standards for medical devices and protects patient privacy.. <br>
            By providing such notice, we establish a framework of clear communication, setting expectations for 
            the continuous support, ethical use, and innovative enhancement of our technology. </p>
