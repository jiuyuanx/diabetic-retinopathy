      <h1>Global Explanation</h1>
      <h2>Overall System Functioning and Role of Automation</h2>
      <p>Our diabetic retinopathy detection app is engineered to leverage the capabilities of modern smartphones combined with a simple lens 
            attachment, enabling trained users such as nurses and volunteers to conduct preliminary screenings for this eye condition. 
            The core functionality of this system lies in its use of a sophisticated deep learning model, based on the ResNet50 architecture, 
            which analyzes images captured by the smartphone's camera. This automation plays a crucial role by providing a preliminary 
            assessment of the patientâ€™s risk for diabetic retinopathy, thus enabling early intervention. Automation significantly 
            enhances the app's ability to process and interpret complex visual data quickly and accurately, offering a crucial diagnostic 
            support tool in environments where traditional medical equipment is scarce and before it's too late! </p>
      <h2>Notice of System Use for Individual and Organization Responsible</h2>
      <p>
        Our diabetic retinopathy detection app is actively deployed with a clear notice to all users, including healthcare providers,
         ensuring they are fully informed that the system is in use. This transparency is crucial not only for maintaining trust but also for 
         facilitating effective collaboration among all stakeholders involved. These include:<br>
        - Data Scientists who develop the models ensuring data integrity and model fairness.<br>
        - Healthcare IT teams who integrate the app within existing health systems to enhance accessibility and usability.<br>
        - Software Engineers who are responsible for deploying models and building robust systems.<br>
        - Ethics boards who rigorously review our app to ensure it upholds the highest standards of fairness and transparency.<br>
        - Regulatory authorities who verify that our app complies with all legal standards for medical devices and maintains patient privacy.<br>
        By providing such a notice, we establish a framework of clear communication, setting expectations for continuous support, 
        ethical use, and innovative enhancement of our technology, thus supporting a more integrated and responsible approach to 
        healthcare diagnostics.
